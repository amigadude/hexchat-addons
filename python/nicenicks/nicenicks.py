## Nice Nicks, version <whatever it says down there>
## maintained by BurritoBazooka (burritobazooka@googlemail.com)
## authored by Chris Gahan (chris@ill-logic.com), licensed under the WTFPL version 2.
## 
## What is this?
##   This is an X-Chat script written in python which colourizes all the nicks in a channel.
##   It will check if you've got nick colouring enabled in X-Chat when it starts up, but you
##   can enable/disable it with the /NICENICKS command. It's better than the built-in colouring 
##   system because that one frqeuently assigns two people in a channel the same colour when 
##   there are still MANY unused colours.
##
## Type /HELP NICENICKS for usage info.
##
## Features:
##   + Colourize nicks based on least-recently-used colour. (When a user who has no colour starts
##     talking, it picks the colour that hasn't been used in the longest time.)
##   + Assign specific colours to specific nicks. This steals colours from other users. ;)
## 
## Features to add: (+ = new cool thing, * = bugfix, - = something else)
##   + if nicks are similar length, capitalized the same, or start with same letter, assign them
##     different colours. also, if nicks are totally different lengths, capitalization, letters
##     give them the same colours.
##   + Could also do this when we see two users' nicks occurring close together very frequently
##     over time, making them easier to differentiate in a conversation.
##   + Another idea for doing nick colouring is to assign more than one colour to a nick which has
##     more than one recognisable part. For example, "JoeBloggs17" could have "Joe",
##     "Bloggs", and "17" coloured differently to each other - for more uniqueness.
##   + XChat compatibility. Currently when trying to port this script back to XChat, strange
##     behaviour was encountered where a caught event would be treated normally anyway, even
##     though our callback returned EAT_XCHAT or EAT_ALL. I don't know how to solve that.
##
##      --------------------------[amigadude changes]------------------------------
##      changed file modes to binary (wb & rb) near the pickle calls
##      changed has_key to in (python3 - "if permacolortable.has_key(nick):2 becomes
##                              "if nick in permacolortable:")
